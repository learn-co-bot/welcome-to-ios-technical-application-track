## Welcome to the iOS Technical Applicatiom 

Thank you for submitting your written application to Flatiron School's iOS Development program. As the next step, we'd like for you to complete a series of labs that will assess your skills in Swift. We don't expect you to be an expert, but below are the topics that will be covered over the course of these five labs:

Variables and Functions
Conditional Statements
Arrays
Looping
XCode and Playgrounds

If you experience any product issues (for example, are your lights not working? Are you having trouble opening labs? Are you having trouble submitting labs?) please email support@learn.co. If you feel that there are problems with the actual lesson content, then please submit an issue via Learn.

Once you complete this track, you may be contacted for a technical interview with a Flatiron School instructor.

Good luck and happy coding!
