# Welcome to the iOS Technical Application 

Thank you for submitting your written application to Flatiron School's iOS Development program. As the next step, we'd like for you to complete a series of labs that will assess your skills in Swift. These labs are interspersed throughout this track and we have a lot of extra content that teaches you all the concepts you need to help you solve the lab. 

We don't expect you to be an expert, but below are the topics that will be covered over the course of these five labs:
* Variables
* Functions
* Conditional Statements
* Arrays
* Looping (iterating over an Array)
* Working in Xcode / Playground

While you don't have to complete every lesson in this track, in order to apply for the iOS program you need to make sure that you've done these following labs: 

* **1) Function Fun Lab**
* **2) Fun with Basics Lab**
* **3) Iterating Over Arrays Playgrounds Lab**
* **4) Array Challenge Lab**
* **5) Deli Counter Lab**


Xcode is at the center of the Apple development experience. In order to create an iOS, tvOS, MacOS or watchOS app, you will need to use Xcode. You're required to be on a Mac because Xcode can only be downloaded from the Mac App Store.You can download Xcode [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12). If you don't have it installed already, we recommend you download it now as it can take up to 30 minutes to get set up. In the next lesson, we'll walk you through all the steps involved in set-up. We'll also walk you through solving a lab. Some of the concepts might be a little confusing but they'll become a lot clearer as you go through the track. 

Xcode is an IDE (integrated development environment) used for software development like making iPhone apps. You will be solving the upcoming labs in Xcode writing Swift code. No, not *fast* code. Swift is the name of the programming language that you will be using when working within Xcode.

If you experience any product issues (for example, are your lights not working? Are you having trouble opening labs? Are you having trouble submitting labs?), please email support@learn.co. If you feel that there are problems with the actual lesson content, then please submit an issue via Learn.

Once you complete this track, you may be contacted for a technical interview with a Flatiron School instructor.

Good luck and happy coding!
